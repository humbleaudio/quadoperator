In brief:

A bank of phase-locked 4 operators plus frequency modulation for FM synthesis patches.


Operator features:
- Ratio: Define an integer multiplier for the operator frequency relative to base tuning
  - 0.5, 1-48
- Detune: control for specifying non-integer phase relationships (+- semitone, center detent = 0 detune)
- Shape: controls waveform over a continuously morphing a sine->tri->square->saw continuum
- Fixed vs. Track switch:
  - In track mode, operator respects base tuning and v/o
  - In fixed mode, operator ignores base tuning and v/o. ratio and detune act like coarse/fine tuning controls.
- Index CV input:
  - For manipulation of operator level via external modulation sources (index level affects all modulation destinations)
  - Normalled to +5V for sustained modulation without an external modulation source
  - Unipolor 0 to 5V (standard Doepfer envelope range)
- Shape CV input:
  - Same effect as changes to shape knob
  - Bipolar +- 5V CV
- Individual audio signal output per operator

Modulation matrix:
- Defines the modulation relationships between operators (including feedback self-modulation)
- Each potentiometer specifies the maximum amount of modulation applied when a source operator's index is at maximum value
- Apply an external modulation source to the operators (e.g., noise)


Other Features:
- Coarse/fine to specify a base tuning for all operators
- Inputs for an external modulation source signal and index (e.g., modulation with noise)
- v/o & fm (for sub-audio rate vibrato effects)
- Reset CV input for phase reseting by gate/trigger


Specs:
- 26 hp
