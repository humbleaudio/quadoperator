Hello!

This repo contains the source code for the Humble Audio Quad Operator. We're open sourcing the code under a Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0). More information is available in the LICENSE file.

To build the project:

1) Download & install the ARM GCC toolchain from https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads

2) Update quadop/makefile to point the TOOLCHAIN_PATH variable to point to the GCC install location on your computer. By default it poins to the install location for macOS.

3) Run:

$ make -f quadop/makefile

Sorry, I'm not a Windows user and may not have made this simple for Windows users. Unfortunately, I can't help there. Hopefully someone from the community can help sort out those issues!


Take care,
Will
