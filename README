Hello!

This is a quick and dirty version of this release for Audio Developer Conference 2021.
At present you won't be able to build the code properly without some more work on my
part! But here *is* the code and schematics for the Humble Audio Quad Operator, which
I am now releasing under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
license. See LICENSE file for more details.

In time, I'll get this repo tidied up for those who want to build custom firmware for
the Quad Operator.

For now, I hope you enjoy a look at the code and schematics!

Take care,
Will
